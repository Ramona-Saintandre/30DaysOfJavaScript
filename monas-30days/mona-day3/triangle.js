// Exercises: Level 2
// Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

// Enter base: 20
// Enter height: 10
// The area of the triangle is 50
// Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)

// Enter side a: 5
// Enter side b: 4
// Enter side c: 3
// The perimeter of the triangle is 12
// Get length and width using prompt and calculate an area of rectangle (area = length x width and the perimeter of rectangle (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))

// Get radius using prompt and calculate the area of a circle (area = pi x r x r) and circumference of a circle(c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.

// Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2

// Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope between point (2, 2) and point(6,10)

// Compare the slope of above two questions.

// Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.
